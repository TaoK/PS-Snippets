This is a collection of Powershell scripts / snippets that don't warrant their own "project" (yet?), 
but are too complex or interrelated to simply publish as independent Gists.

For now, the only one in active ongoing use is "TunneledClientLauncher.ps1", which sets up an SSH
session and tunnel, and then launches a target client program; useful for remote access scenarios.
